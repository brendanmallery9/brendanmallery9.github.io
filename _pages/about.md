I am a 4th year PhD candidate studying mathematics at Tufts University, working with Professors [James Murphy](https://jmurphy.math.tufts.edu/) and [Shuchin Aeron](https://sites.google.com/view/shuchin-aeron/home?authuser=0). I obtained a Masters in mathematics from SUNY Albany in 2020, and a B.A. in mathematics and chemistry from Bowdoin College in 2018. For more details, see my [CV](assets/cv/brendan_mallery_resume.pdf).

My research is in optimal transportation, with a focus on statistical theory and applications to data science. In particular:

- Statistical aspects of entropic optimal transport/Schrodinger bridges;
- Nonlinear dimensionality reduction and component analysis using optimal transportation;
- Analysis of Wasserstein gradient flows/descent, and applications to inference, sampling, and generative modeling.

In addition to my dissertation work, I am also interested in:

- Interactions between optimal transport and Ricci curvature
- Modeling and analysis of time-evolving networks

I was introduced to the latter topic through my work at NASA Glenn Research & Goddard Space Flight Centers (2020-2023).
